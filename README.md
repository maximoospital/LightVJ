## Manual build

This program is only available as a compiled binary for Windows, however, if you want to build your own Linux or Mac version, you can go ahead and compile it yourself, or just run the source code.

Keep in mind this was coded in Python 3.9.10, so it might not work well under older versions (May god help you if you're still on Python 2.6)

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/maximoospital/LightVJ.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd LightVJ
```

Install requirements

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run app

```bash
  python lightvj.py
```

### Linux and other operating systems (Builds â‰¤ 1.1)

Since this app was built quickly and mainly for my Windows computer, it utilizes certain shortcuts that work perfectly in Windows 10, but not might work as well in other OSes;
